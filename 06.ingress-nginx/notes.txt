ingress-nginx
- send traffic from internet to your cluster
- ingress controller acts as a proxy to your services 
- ingress-controller evaluates all the rules set on your Ingress manifest and manages redirections.
- there are many different third party implementations
- example is K8s Nginx Ingress controller
- consider the env where the cluster is running
- for cloud services, they have Cloud Load Balancer
- the traffic will first hit the 'Cloud Load Balancer' then hit 'Ingress Controller Pod' .
- with cloud, you do not have to implement load balancer by yourself 
- for bare metal, you need a 'Proxy Server' which can be a hardware or software.
- this is a separate sever with public ip address and open port 
- it is the entry point to your cluster 
- it will then access Ingress Controller which will then check Ingress rules and redirect traffic 
- none of the cluster will be accessible to the public
